# CollabArt
## A social media website for Artisans to promote their work and support them.
CollabArt is built using the **Django framework** and deployed using **Heroku**.

Artisans of the nation have inadequate and limited resources. Issues like restricted market space, lower bids, and lack of means to expand their business reach across physical borders are the principal causes for artisans quitting their skill. *“India’s handicrafts exports nosedive 40%; artisans turn daily wagers to make ends meet.”* quoted a stades article dated October 26, 2020. 
This decline calls for a medium that can connect the general public to the workers, can be easily used, and is platform-independent. Creating a social platform for artisans where they can share their art and can connect to the general public through it is the need of the hour.
